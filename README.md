Steps
-------

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Convert stories into a representative domain model and test-drive your work.
4. Run your tests using `npm test` or `node specRunner.js`
5. OPTIONAL: [Lint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) your source code using `npx eslint src`.

Task
-----

Write A software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories:

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct the airport to land a plane

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

//
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
//

//
As an air traffic controller
To avoid confusion
I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed
//
```

#### Extended Acceptance Criteria
```
As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To count planes easily
Planes that have landed must be at an airport
```

The task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/objects to satisfy all the above user stories. A random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In the tests, it needs to stub random behaviour to ensure consistent test behaviour.

Code should defend against [edge cases](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b) such as inconsistent states of the system ensuring that planes can only take off from airports they are in; planes that are already flying cannot take off and/or be in an airport; planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in an airport, etc.
